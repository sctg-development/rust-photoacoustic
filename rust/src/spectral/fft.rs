//! Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) implementation for spectral analysis
//!
//! This module provides functionality for analyzing signals in the frequency domain
//! using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). It includes:
//!
//! - A trait-based approach for spectral analysis with the `SpectralAnalyzer` trait
//! - An FFT-based implementation `FFTAnalyzer` using the rustfft library
//! - Support for different window functions to reduce spectral leakage
//! - Capability for spectral averaging to improve signal-to-noise ratio
//! - Amplitude and phase extraction from frequency-domain signals
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use rust_photoacoustic::spectral::fft::{FFTAnalyzer, SpectralAnalyzer, WindowFunction};
//!
//! // Create a test signal (a sine wave at 1000 Hz)
//! let sample_rate = 44100;
//! let frequency = 1000.0;
//! let duration = 1.0; // seconds
//! let num_samples = (sample_rate as f32 * duration) as usize;
//!
//! let mut signal = vec![0.0; num_samples];
//! for i in 0..num_samples {
//!     let t = i as f32 / sample_rate as f32;
//!     signal[i] = (2.0 * std::f32::consts::PI * frequency * t).sin();
//! }
//!
//! // Create an FFT analyzer with a window size of 4096 and 3 averages
//! let mut analyzer = FFTAnalyzer::new(4096, 3);
//!
//! // Analyze the signal
//! let spectrum = analyzer.analyze(&signal, sample_rate).unwrap();
//!
//! // Get the amplitude at the expected frequency
//! let amplitude = analyzer.get_amplitude_at(frequency).unwrap();
//! println!("Amplitude at {} Hz: {}", frequency, amplitude);
//!
//! // Print the first few frequency bins
//! for i in 0..10 {
//!     println!("Frequency: {:.2} Hz, Amplitude: {:.6}",
//!              spectrum.frequencies[i],
//!              spectrum.amplitudes[i]);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Spectral Analysis Process
//!
//! 1. Window the time-domain signal to reduce spectral leakage
//! 2. Compute the FFT of the windowed signal
//! 3. Average multiple FFTs if enabled (to reduce noise)
//! 4. Extract amplitude and phase information
//! 5. Return the results as a `SpectrumData` structure
