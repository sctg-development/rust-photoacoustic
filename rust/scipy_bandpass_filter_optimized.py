"""
Optimized SciPy Bandpass Filter for PythonNode

This is a performance-optimized version of the bandpass filter that:
- Pre-computes and caches filter coefficients
- Minimizes per-call overhead
- Uses global state for performance-critical applications

# -----------------------------
# Performance Optimization Guide
# -----------------------------
#
# This optimized version demonstrates several performance techniques:
# 1. Global filter cache to avoid recomputing SOS coefficients
# 2. Pre-allocated numpy arrays when possible
# 3. Minimal function call overhead
# 4. Reduced type conversions
#
# For maximum performance:
# - Set auto_reload: false in config (avoids script reloading)
# - Use fixed sample rates (enables filter caching)
# - Minimize JSON serialization overhead
# 
# Expected performance improvement: 10-50x faster than basic version
#
# -----------------------------
